# Basics

Some links to websites, articles, guides and documentation that should be useful to learn or brush up on various topics. Starting with the websites I use daily:

## The best links
- [Google](https://google.com)
    - Of course.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - Every question you could have about any kind of development has been answered here. Google usually leads you here.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)
    - If Google doesn't lead you to Stack Overflow it leads you to Mozilla's developer site, which has documentation and guides for everything about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs and other stuff. 
- [Can I use?](https://caniuse.com/)
    - Website that keeps track of browser compatibility of web technologies. For example: do [ES6 Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) work in IE11? [Of course not!](https://caniuse.com/#feat=template-literals)

## HTML

    - Super useful tool.

## jQuery
- [jQuery API documentation](https://api.jquery.com/)
- [jQuery learning center](https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/)
    - A handy overview of all the core concepts.

## Sharepoint
