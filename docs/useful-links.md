# Basics

Some links to websites, articles, guides and documentation that should be useful to learn or brush up on various topics. Starting with the websites I use daily:

## The best links
- [Google](https://google.com)
    - Of course.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - Every question you could have about any kind of development has been answered here. Google usually leads you here.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)
    - If Google doesn't lead you to Stack Overflow it leads you to Mozilla's developer site, which has documentation and guides for everything about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs and other stuff. 
- [Can I use?](https://caniuse.com/)
    - Website that keeps track of browser compatibility of web technologies. For example: do [ES6 Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) work in IE11? [Of course not!](https://caniuse.com/#feat=template-literals)

## HTML
- [HTML basics on MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

## CCS
- [CSS basics on MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)

## JavaScript
- [JavaScript basics on MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)
- [Overview of the console in Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/)
    - Super useful tool.
- [Equality comparisons and sameness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness)
    - Difference between `==` and `===` explained.
    - [These tables](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/) give a pretty handy overview.
    - Basically: `===` is the most reliable and straight-forward way of comparing values. Makes for the most readable code.
- [Truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) and [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)
    - We frequently use these in if statements to check whether values exist.


## jQuery
- [jQuery API documentation](https://api.jquery.com/)
- [jQuery learning center](https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/)
    - A handy overview of all the core concepts.

## Sharepoint
- [SPServices](http://sympmarc.github.io/SPServices/core/web-services.html)
    - "SPServices is a jQuery library which abstracts SharePointâ€™s Web Services and makes them easier to use."

## SPForms
