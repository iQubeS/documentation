# Introduction

The jQuery Resource Planner is a grid-based timeline view that can be used to visualize tasks, schedules, projects etc.

Time is displayed on the x-axis and resources on the y-axis.

## Terminology

Here's some explanation on some of the terminology used in this documentation and in the Resource Planner itself.

##### Item
    
- Each task/project displayed in the grid is called an item. 
	- For example tasks, projects or meetings.

##### Resource
    
- The categories on the y-axis(the first column of the grid) are called resources.
	- For example employees, departments or customers.
