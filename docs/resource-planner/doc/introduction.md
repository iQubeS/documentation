# Introduction

The Resource Planner is a grid-based timeline view that can be used to visualize tasks, schedules, projects etc.

Time is displayed on the x-axis and categories on the y-axis.

## Terminology

Here's some explanation on some of the terminology used in this documentation and in the Resource Planner itself.

- Item
    - Each task/project displayed in the grid is called an item. 
    - Usually they are some task, project or meeting.
- Resource
    - The categories on the y-axis(the first column of the grid) are called resources.
    - Usually they are some employee, department or customer.
